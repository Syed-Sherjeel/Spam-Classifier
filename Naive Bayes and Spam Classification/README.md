# Spam-Classifier
Purpose of this project is to develop a spam classifier system using application of probablity.We will use algorithm known as Naive Bayes in order to classify certain message as spam or non spam.Furthermore we will also give a certain intitution of naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch.
# Getting Stated
In order to be able to run this project we will be needing following packages. 
- numpy
- sklearn
- pandas
- matplotlib
# Installing dependencies
```
pip install sklearn 
pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib 
```
# Usage Example
```
First store message in string variable X
X=message
